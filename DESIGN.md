# Gemini Extension Manager (GEM) Design Document

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the design for the Gemini Extension Manager (GEM), a command-line interface (CLI) tool for managing extensions for the Gemini CLI and other tools. GEM will be written in Rust to ensure performance and cross-platform compatibility.

## 2. Goals and Objectives

*   **Provide a simple and intuitive CLI** for managing extensions.
*   **Support for various extension types**, such as MCP servers, A2A servers, and other tools.
*   **Cross-platform support** for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
*   **A centralized repository** for discovering and sharing extensions.
*   **Secure and reliable** extension installation and management.

## 3. Architecture

GEM will consist of the following components:

*   **CLI:** The main interface for users to interact with GEM.
*   **Extension Registry:** A JSON-based file hosted in a Git repository that contains a list of available extensions.
*   **Extension Manager:** The core logic for installing, uninstalling, updating, and managing extensions.
*   **Extension Host:** A mechanism for running and managing installed extensions.

### 3.1. Extension Registry

The extension registry will be a simple JSON file with the following structure:

```json
{
  "extensions": [
    {
      "name": "example-extension",
      "version": "0.1.0",
      "description": "An example extension.",
      "author": "Gemini",
      "repository": "https://github.com/google-gemini/example-extension",
      "keywords": ["example", "gemini"],
      "installation": {
        "method": "git",
        "url": "https://github.com/google-gemini/example-extension.git"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## 4. CLI Commands

The following commands will be available in GEM:

*   `gem search <query>`: Search for available extensions.
*   `gem install <extension_name>`: Install an extension.
*   `gem uninstall <extension_name>`: Uninstall an extension.
*   `gem update [extension_name]`: Update one or all extensions.
*   `gem list`: List installed extensions.
*   `gem info <extension_name>`: Show information about an extension.

## 5. File System Layout

GEM will use the following directory structure to store its files:

*   `~/.gem/`: The main directory for GEM.
*   `~/.gem/registry/`: A local clone of the extension registry.
*   `~/.gem/extensions/`: The directory where extensions are installed.
*   `~/.gem/config.toml`: The configuration file for GEM.

## 6. Implementation Details

*   **Language:** Rust
*   **CLI Framework:** `clap`
*   **HTTP Client:** `reqwest`
*   **JSON Parsing:** `serde_json`
*   **Git Client:** `git2-rs`

## 7. Roadmap

The development of GEM will be divided into the following milestones:

1.  **Initial Scaffolding:** Create the basic project structure and CLI.
2.  **Implement Core Features:** Implement the `install`, `uninstall`, and `list` commands.
3.  **Implement Extension Registry:** Implement the logic for fetching and parsing the extension registry.
4.  **Implement Remaining Commands:** Implement the `search`, `update`, and `info` commands.
5.  **Testing and CI/CD:** Add comprehensive tests and set up a CI/CD pipeline.
6.  **Initial Release:** Release the first version of GEM.
